'''
an object oriented programming is programming that is oriented around data (made mobile and changable in objects)
rather  than functionality.

object orinted does mmore than just bundle up individua; pirces of data that represent a thing - it also bundles 
customized functions that can be performed on that data. these are called methods. behaviors that an onject performs 
upon its internal sata nad even upon other code objects.

# Class and instances.
'''
Defining a class .
think of a class like a blueprint that defines how to build an object.
the python class both contains the instructions for creating new objects from an assembly line which produces a series of 
similar dog objects based on the same Dog template.

'''

# class Dog:  # the Dog class is defined with the class keyword followed by the class na,e and closed with a  deindentations to the level where we defined the Dog class.
    # class names begin with capital letters becasue they are stored in python constants.if your class name contains two words the name should be U
    # UpperCamelCase also called the pascalCase if your feeling fancyðŸ˜˜.

class MyClass:


# creating class instances. Given the following code 

class Dog:
    pass

fido = Dog()
fido  # we instantiate an instance of a dog class by calling the contructor function Dog(). this creates our instance of the Dog class,
    #   which we assign to the variable fido. instanciate means briging an object to life.
    # if we have several dogs with the names lucy, ben and puff the we instatiate these individual dogs by calling the class costrutor function Dog()
    # we call each individuals, specific dog or versions of our class , instances. 

    # An instance is a single occurence of an obeject. instances refer to the indivdual objects produced from the class.

# creating another intance of a Dog 
suzy = Dog()
suzy
# another instance of the Dog obeject.
puff= Dog()
puff
# suzy and puff are instances of the Dog class.

#  Note that different instances are different Objects.

# note that classes are blueprints that define the behaviour and information our objects will contain.
# To use the class to create individual objects, call the class with closed parentheses as you would a function or method.
# this will instantiate (create a new instance of an object from the class.)
